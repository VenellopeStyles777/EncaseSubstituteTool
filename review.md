# Review - Code and Architecture Review Notes

Purpose: use this file for findings from research/review agents. Keep reviews focused on defects, forensic-soundness risks, data-integrity risks, missing tests, and architecture drift.

Review priorities for this project:

- Evidence must be opened read-only unless an explicit export/write operation targets a separate output path.
- Every parsed file, exported file, hash, and report item should preserve source provenance.
- Long operations need cancellation, progress, and error recovery.
- Tests should use known tiny forensic images or generated fixtures, not uncontrolled real evidence.
- UI convenience must not hide evidence integrity state, parsing errors, or unsupported filesystem/image features.
