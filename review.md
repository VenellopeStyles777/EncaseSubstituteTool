# Review - Code and Architecture Review Notes

Purpose: use this file for findings from research/review agents. Keep reviews focused on defects, forensic-soundness risks, data-integrity risks, missing tests, and architecture drift.

Review priorities for this project:

- Evidence must be opened read-only unless an explicit export/write operation targets a separate output path.
- Every parsed file, exported file, hash, and report item should preserve source provenance.
- Long operations need cancellation, progress, and error recovery.
- Tests should use known tiny forensic images or generated fixtures, not uncontrolled real evidence.
- UI convenience must not hide evidence integrity state, parsing errors, or unsupported filesystem/image features.

## Current Review Queue

- Review S1-T02 for segment discovery without real evidence files.
- Review S1-T03 for dependency-unavailable behavior.
- Confirm S1-T05 case-store schema records evidence provenance and audit events.

## 2026-07-09 - S1-T01/S1-T01A Review

Result: approved for commit.

Findings:

- No blocking issues found.
- The backend package skeleton is intentionally minimal and stays within S1-T01 scope.
- Smoke tests cover package import and backend subpackage import.
- `.gitignore` covers Python cache/test artifacts, virtual environments, and common build outputs.
- `python -m pytest` passed: 2 tests passed, 1 warning.

Residual notes:

- Pytest still reports a non-blocking cache warning under `.pytest_cache`; tests pass.
- No E01 logic is expected in S1-T01. Segment discovery should begin in S1-T02.
