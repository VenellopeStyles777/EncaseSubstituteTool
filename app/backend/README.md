# Backend

Purpose: backend source root for forensic operations and local app services.

Subfolders:

- `forensic_core/`: evidence image adapters, segment discovery, read-only streams, hashing, signatures, filesystem interfaces.
- `case_store/`: SQLite schema, migrations, case metadata, evidence registry, audit events.
- `analysis_workers/`: background jobs for long-running forensic analysis.
- `api/`: local API or command boundary used by the UI.
